# Whiteboarding Introduction
We almost always "whiteboard" ideas before coding them out. **Even when prototyping**. We've come to find, whiteboarding boosts productivity like crazy! There's several reasons for this:
- Devs can developer faster with a **clear vision**, because:
  - vision gets people motivated
  - when coding, the next step is always obvious with a clear vision, because there's no mysteries in "what to do"

To be clear, we're not saying everything you ever code has to be whiteboarded. No. when you're building smaller projects - especially for educational purposes - whiteboarding might make you feel like you don't have freedom. That's not always a bad thing, though we don't want you to feel like you can't experiment.
