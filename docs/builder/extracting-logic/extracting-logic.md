# Extracting Logic
This is the most important concept we'll cover. If we don't know how to extract logic, we don't know how to create maintainable code.

> The key to maintainable code is knowing HOW to extract logic, and WHERE to extract logic.

We'll cover:
- the how and where of extracting **components** (SFCs)
- the how and where of extracting **logic** (usually composables, sometimes helpers)
- managing complexity (how extracting relates to the `page > views > components` architecture)
