We&#39;ve come to find, whiteboarding boosts productivity like crazy! There&#39;s several reasons for this:</p><ul><li>Devs can developer faster with a <strong>clear vision</strong>, because: <ul><li>vision gets people motivated</li><li>when coding, the next step is always obvious with a clear vision, because there&#39;s no mysteries in &quot;what to do&quot;</li></ul></li></ul><p>To be clear, we&#39;re not saying everything you ever code has to be whiteboarded. No. when you&#39;re building smaller projects - especially for educational purposes - whiteboarding might make you feel like you don&#39;t have freedom. That&#39;s not always a bad thing, though we don&#39;t want you to feel like you can&#39;t experiment.</p>',4),r=[n];function s(d,c,l,h,u,p){return o(),t("div",null,r)}const b=e(a,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,b as default};
