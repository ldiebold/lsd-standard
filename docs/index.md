# The LSD Standard

- immediate comfort and clarity when switching between projects.

## When do I/don't I use this standard?
The LSD standard is for teams, or individuals building **large applications** (though as it becomes second nature, you'll likely want to use it on small projects too).

Please don't feel like you have to follow these rules religiously when building your own projects! Yes, they must be followed closely as possible when working with large teams. These rules create an invisible line of communication, and produce clarity. When two people follow this standard, they immediately feel comfortable, and able to edit/matintain the codebase.
