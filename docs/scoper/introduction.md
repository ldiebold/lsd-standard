# Introduction
Scopers only make sense in projects where the **client already has a clear vision of what they want built**.

## How A Scopers Role Works
1. A potential new client wants an app built, and they have a clear idea of the problem they want solved
2. A **scoper** spends a few days with the client building the UI, and ensuring that it's **exactly what the client wants**
3. Scopers DO NOT build a backend. They **use fake data** so the client has a visual, interactive example of the finished product
4. The client signs off on this product, and a price can now be negotiated

The client in this example could also be a product manager, or even employee from a different department in an organization (for example, when building a small tool to make key employees more efficient).

## The Skillset Of A Scoper
- build a prototype **fast**
- build with the **correct architecture** (this is made easy via the modular quasar generators)
- whiteboard so there's **clarity** on what the client **actually wants**
  - especially important. There are almost always gaps in what the client thinks they want, and the real world
